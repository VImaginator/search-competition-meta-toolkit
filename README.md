# search-competition-meta-toolkit\nOptimizing a Textual Search Engine with MeTa data sciences toolkit competition.\n\nRanked 9th on the leaderboard for over 1000 submissions.\n\nWelcome to the UIUC's CS 410: Text Information Systems  Search Competition! For this assignment, we have created a new data set, from Microsoft's Academic Search Engine, that contains abstracts and titles from published work in major IR conferences (called MAS data set).\n\nYou will learn how to create a test collection to evaluate a search engine, how to modify a search engine to improve its accuracy, and explore your own ideas to improve a search engine and "compete" with a baseline search engine.\n\nWe will use the test collection annotated by all the students to quantitatively evaluate your search engine. This public leaderboard will enable all the students to compete with each other in optimizing a search engine.\n\nIMPORTANT: Please make sure to use your netid as nickname.\n\nIMPORTANT: The name of the submission file should be output.txt and prior to submitting it must be zip-archived. The final file format is output.txt.
